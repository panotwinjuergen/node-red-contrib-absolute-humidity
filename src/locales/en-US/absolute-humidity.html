<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="absolute-humidity" lang="en-US">
Calculates the absolute humidity and dew point for a given relative humidity and air temperature.
    
### Configuration
    
The node can be configured with custom message topics for both temperature and relative humidity inputs:
    
- **Temperature Topic**: The topic name for temperature messages (default: "temperature")
- **Relative Humidity Topic**: The topic name for relative humidity messages (default: "relativeHumidity")

- **Formula**: Choose between two calculation methods:
  - **Wetterochs**: Classic Magnus formula implementation, valid for temperatures between -45°C and 60°C
  - **Mark G. Lawrence**: Alternative implementation with (±0.35°C), valid for temperatures between -40°C and 50°C
    
### Inputs
  
The node accepts inputs in three ways:

1. Using message properties:
   - `msg.relativeHumidity` (number): the relative humidity [%]
   - `msg.temperature` (number): the air temperature [°C]

2. Using configured topics:
   - Messages with the configured temperature topic and `msg.payload` (number) for temperature [°C]
   - Messages with the configured humidity topic and `msg.payload` (number) for relative humidity [%]

3. Using datapoint identifiers:
   - Messages with `msg.datapoint = "ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE"` and `msg.payload` (number) for temperature [°C]
   - Messages with `msg.datapoint = "HUMIDITY"` and `msg.payload` (number) for relative humidity [%]

### Input Validation

The node validates the relative humidity input to ensure accurate calculations:

- Valid range: 0% to 100%
- Values outside this range will:
   - Trigger an error message
   - Show a red status indicator
   - Not produce output values
- Validation applies to all input methods (properties, topics, and datapoints)

The node also validates the temperature input:

- Valid range depends on the selected formula:
  - Wetterochs formula: -45°C to 60°C
  - Lawrence formula: -40°C to 50°C
- Values outside these ranges will:
  - Trigger an error message with the valid range
  - Show a red status indicator
  - Not produce output values
- Validation applies to all input methods
- The Lawrence formula provides an accuracy (±0.35°C) within its temperature range

### Outputs

: msg.absoluteHumidity (number)	: the absolute humidity [g/m³], rounded to one decimal place
: msg.dewPoint (number)		: the dew point [°C], rounded to one decimal place

### Details
    
The node needs two measurements to calculate the absolute humidity and dew point:
    
`relativeHumidity` is a measure of the amount of water vapor present in the air compared to the maximum amount of vapor the air can hold at its current temperature. It is expressed as a percentage [%].

`temperature` represents the current air temperature, measured in degrees Celsius [°C].

Based on these two measurements, the node calculates two additional properties, which are stored in the outgoing message:

`absoluteHumidity` quantifies the actual amount of water vapor in the air, independent of air temperature. It is measured in grams of water per cubic meter of air [g/m³].

The dew point `dewPoint` indicates the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. As the air cools, its ability to hold moisture decreases. If it is cooled below the dew point, water vapor will condense into liquid water. This can lead to the formation of water (dew) on surfaces when the air comes into contact with a cooler object. The dew point is measured in degrees Celsius [°C].

### Calculation Methods

The node offers two different methods for calculating dew point and absolute humidity:

1. **Wetterochs Formula** (Classic Magnus)
   - Based on the Magnus formula from wetterochs.de
   - Valid temperature range: -45°C to 60°C
   - Uses different parameters for temperatures above and below 0°C
   - Widely used in meteorological applications

2. **Mark G. Lawrence Formula**
   - Published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (2005)
   - Valid temperature range: -40°C to 50°C
   - Improved accuracy: ±0.35°C
   - Uses optimized constants for better precision
   - Recommended for applications requiring high accuracy
