<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="absolute-humidity" lang="en-US">
Calculates the absolute humidity and dew point for a given relative humidity and air temperature.
    
### Configuration
    
The node can be configured with custom message topics for both temperature and relative humidity inputs:
    
- **Temperature Topic**: The topic name for temperature messages (default: "temperature")
- **Relative Humidity Topic**: The topic name for relative humidity messages (default: "relativeHumidity")
    
### Inputs
  
The node accepts inputs in three ways:

1. Using message properties:
   - `msg.relativeHumidity` (number): the relative humidity [%]
   - `msg.temperature` (number): the air temperature [°C]

2. Using configured topics:
   - Messages with the configured temperature topic and `msg.payload` (number) for temperature [°C]
   - Messages with the configured humidity topic and `msg.payload` (number) for relative humidity [%]

3. Using datapoint identifiers:
   - Messages with `msg.datapoint = "ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE"` and `msg.payload` (number) for temperature [°C]
   - Messages with `msg.datapoint = "HUMIDITY"` and `msg.payload` (number) for relative humidity [%]

### Outputs

: msg.absoluteHumidity (number)	: the absolute humidity [g/m³], rounded to one decimal place
: msg.dewPoint (number)		: the dew point [°C], rounded to one decimal place

### Details
    
The received message shall contain two properties:
    
`relativeHumidity` is a measure of the amount of water vapor present in the air compared to the maximum amount of vapor the air can hold at its current temperature. It is expressed as a percentage [%].

`temperature` represents the current air temperature, measured in degrees Celsius [°C].

Based on these two measures, the node calculates two additional properties, which are stored in the outgoing message:

`absoluteHumidity` quantifies the actual amount of water vapor in the air, independent of air temperature. It is measured in grams of water per cubic meter of air [g/m³].

The dew point `dewPoint` indicates the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. As the air cools, its ability to hold moisture decreases. If it is cooled below the dew point, water vapor will condense into liquid water. This can lead to the formation of water (dew) on surfaces when the air comes into contact with a cooler object. The dew point is measured in degrees Celsius [°C].
